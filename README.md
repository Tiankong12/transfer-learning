7. ***SqueezeNet*** :  [SquezzeNet](https://github.com/DeepScale/SqueezeNet) detects the dominant objects present in an image from a set of 1000 categories such as trees, animals, food, vehicles, people, and more. With an overall footprint of only 5 MB, SqueezeNet has a similar level of accuracy as AlexNet but with 50 times fewer parameters.[source](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/)
